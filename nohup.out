There is no manual on how to play, as most of the fun is figuring out what commands are included in the game.  To move around however, you use the command "go north" to go north, "go east" to go east, and so on.  Additionally, some of the tougher locations in the game have hints to get you past the location.  Enter "hint" when in a room to get a hint on how to beat the room.<br/>
